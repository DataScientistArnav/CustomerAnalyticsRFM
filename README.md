### Key Components

#### Customer Segmentation
Using **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), we categorized customers into the following segments:

- **High-Value Customers (20%)**: Most profitable, consistent buyers contributing **52.3% of monetary value**.
- **Loyal Customers (20.8%)**: Frequent purchasers and brand advocates, contributing **20.5% of monetary value**.
- **Potential Loyalists (19.8%)**: Emerging customers with high growth potential, contributing **12.4% of monetary value**.
- **At Risk Customers (19.4%)**: Declining purchases, offering retention opportunities, contributing **8.5% of monetary value**.
- **Lost Customers (19.9%)**: Previously active or one-time customers, contributing **6.3% of monetary value**.

#### Key Insights
- High-Value Customers drive over half of the total revenue, highlighting the importance of loyalty retention.
- Potential Loyalists show strong growth potential and should be nurtured for long-term profitability.
- At Risk and Lost Customers require selective investment to optimize returns.
